# Android Waste Disposal Locator App using Dijkstra's Algorithm
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my thesis project, an Android application designed to facilitate waste disposal location search using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Introduction
As part of my academic journey, I developed this Android application with the aim of providing users with a convenient tool to find nearby waste disposal points. The application utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm, a well-known algorithm in graph theory, to efficiently calculate the shortest path between the user's location and the nearest waste disposal center.

## Key Features

The Android Waste Disposal Locator app boasts the following features:

    User-friendly interface: The app offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
    Current location tracking: Users can easily input their current location or allow the app to access their device's GPS to automatically detect their location.
    Waste disposal center search: The app searches for the nearest waste disposal centers based on the user's location and displays the results on the map.
    Shortest path calculation: Leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm, the app efficiently calculates the shortest path between the user's location and the selected waste disposal center.
    Step-by-step directions: The app provides clear step-by-step directions and navigation instructions to guide users to the chosen waste disposal center.
    User feedback and reviews: Users can leave reviews and ratings for the waste disposal centers they visit, helping others make informed decisions.

## How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works

Dijkstra's algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. In the context of this Android application, the algorithm calculates the shortest distance from the user's current location to each waste disposal center, determining the most efficient path. By employing Dijkstra's algorithm, the app ensures that users are directed to the nearest and most accessible waste disposal center in their vicinity.
